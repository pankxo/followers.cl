## Logo Implementation Complete ✅

The website header has been successfully updated to display a logo image instead of the Instagram icon + text.

### To Use Your Custom Logo:

1. **Replace the placeholder**: Save your logo image as `logo.png` in this directory
2. **Logo specifications**:
   - Format: PNG (required)
   - Background: Transparent recommended for professional look
   - Dimensions: 200-300px width recommended, proportional height
   - Resolution: High resolution for crisp display on all devices

### Current Implementation:

- ✅ Header now uses `<img>` tag instead of icon + text
- ✅ Responsive design: Scales properly on desktop and mobile
- ✅ Professional styling with hover effect
- ✅ Fallback to SVG if PNG is not found
- ✅ Centered layout without white margins
- ✅ Desktop: 40px height, up to 200px width
- ✅ Mobile: 32px height, up to 160px width

The logo will automatically appear once you place your `logo.png` file in this directory.
